# ejScroller




The Scroller control has a sliding document whose position corresponds to a value. The document has text, HTML content or images. You can also customize the Scroller control by resizing the scrolling bar and changing the theme.



#### Syntax

{% highlight javascript %}

$(element).ejScroller()

{% endhighlight %}








#### Example



{% highlight html %}
 
<div id="scrollcontent" style="width:900px;">
<p>Model view controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the
representation of information from the user's interaction with it.
The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any
output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data 
are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. 
The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The central 
ideas behind MVC are code reusability and n addition to dividing the application into three 
kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions between them.

<ul>
<li>
<b>A controller</b>  can send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., by scrolling through a document). 
         It can also send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document).
</li>
</ul>     
</div> 
 
<script>
// Create Scroller
$('#scrollcontent').ejScroller();       
</script>

<p>Model view controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the
representation of information from the user's interaction with it.
The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any
output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data 
are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. 
The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The central 
ideas behind MVC are code reusability and n addition to dividing the application into three 
kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions between them.

<ul>
<li>
<b>A controller </b>can send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the model (e.g., by scrolling through a document). 
It can also send commands to the model to update the model's state (e.g., editing a document).
</li>
</ul> 
</div> 
 
<script>
// To check horizontal scrollbar is rendered or not

### isVScroll()
{:#methods:isvscroll}




Returns true if vertical scrollbar is shown, else return false.



#### Returns:
